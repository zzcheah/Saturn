# Project Saturn

#### Goal: To explore and learn Spring Cloud, Azure DevOps and Kubernetes
#### Methodology: Build a system using the above technologies

<hr/>

## Proposed System: 

An Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system that does the following:

###_Basic EDI operations_

1. Receive files from multiple external clients, perform data mapping, and store to organization internal systems for further processing.<br/><br/>
2. Retrieve data from organizational internal systems, write into file and deliver to multiple external clients.<br/><br/>
3. Data exchange with external systems may be done through various protocols, e.g. HTTP/s, FTP/SFTP polling.<br/><br/>


###_Spring Cloud explorations_

4. Implement Spring Cloud Sleuth to generate trace ID for each transaction.<br/><br/>
5. Integrate with Spring Cloud Stream (Kafka) to allow trace ID to be propagate through asynchronous data processing.<br/><br/>
6. Integrate with Graylog to aggregate logs based on trace ID generated by Spring Cloud Sleuth.<br/><br/>
7. (Optional) Implement Spring Cloud Zipkin to enable distributed tracing.<br/><br/>


###_Kubernetes explorations_

8. Deploy Spring Boot applications on Kubernetes.<br/><br/>
9. Store sensitive data (e.g. client authentication tokens) in Kubernetes Secrets to be used by Spring Boot applications.<br/><br/>
10. Store spring boot configurations in Kubernetes Config Maps.<br/><br/>
11.	Implement live reload to configurations by using Spring Cloud Kubernetes library.<br/><br/>


###_Azure DevOps explorations_

12.	Manage Maven artifact versioning using Artifact Feed.<br/><br/>
13.	Perform deployment using Azure Pipelines and artifacts in Artifact Feed.<br/><br/>
14.	Track work progress using Azure DevOps Board.<br/><br/>
15.	Sparse checkout for shorter CI.<br/><br/>
16.	Self-hosted agent for shorter CI.<br/><br/>


###_Java/Maven explorations_

17.	BOM file for consistency in library version used by every micro services.<br/><br/>
18.	Explore functional programming.<br/><br/>
