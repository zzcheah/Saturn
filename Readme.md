Project			: Saturn
Goal			: To explore and learn Spring Cloud, Azure DevOps and Kubernetes
Methodology 		: Build a system using the above technologies

Proposed System: 

An Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system that does the following:

Basic EDI operations

i.	Receive files from multiple external clients, perform data mapping, and store to organization internal systems for further processing.

ii.	Retrieve data from organizational internal systems, write into file and deliver to multiple external clients.

iii.	Data exchange with external systems may be done through various protocols, e.g. HTTP/s, FTP/SFTP polling.


Spring Cloud explorations

iv.	Implement Spring Cloud Sleuth to generate trace ID for each transaction.

v.	Integrate with Spring Cloud Stream (Kafka) to allow trace ID to be propagate through asynchronous data processing.

vi.	Integrate with Graylog to aggregate logs based on trace ID generated by Spring Cloud Sleuth.

vii.	(Optional) Implement Spring Cloud Zipkin to enable distributed tracing.


Kubernetes explorations

viii.	Deploy Spring Boot applications on Kubernetes. 

ix.	Store sensitive data (e.g. client authentication tokens) in Kubernetes Secrets to be used by Spring Boot applications.

x.	Store spring boot configurations in Kubernetes Config Maps.

xi.	Implement live reload to configurations by using Spring Cloud Kubernetes library.

 
Azure DevOps explorations

xii.	Manage Maven artifact versioning using Artifact Feed.

xiii.	Perform deployment using Azure Pipelines and artifacts in Artifact Feed.

xiv.	Track work progress using Azure DevOps Board

xv.	Sparse checkout for shorter CI 

xvi.	Self-hosted agent for shorter CI


Java/Maven explorations

xvii.	BOM file for consistency in library version used by every micro services. 

xviii.	Explore functional programming.
